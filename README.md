# spring-jersey-jackson-boilerplate

Good starting point for the project that enables RESTful interface to access resources in JPA enabled datastore

## Intro

I found myself struggling with different versions of different frameworks that I've been using in my projects that provide RESTful API for JPA enabled data store. I decided to spend some time to come up with boilerplate project that is using the most recent libraries to achieve my goal. 
So my dependencies are:
- Spring 3.2.6
- Hibernate 4.3.0
- Jersey 2.5.1
- Jackson 2.3.0

Feel free to use for any purposes. Comments and suggestions are welcome
